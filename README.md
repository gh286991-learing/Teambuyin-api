# TeamBuying-api

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

API for TeamBuying.


## Develop

### Run API inside docker

To bring up database (TeamBuying-mysql) and TeamBuying-api containers, simply run:
```
docker-compose up
```

To clean up containers, simply run:
```
docker-compose down
```

To rebuild the api image
```
docker-compose up --build
```

If you need to install a new package, it's best to do it this way:
```
yarn add PACKAGE_NAME

# then you'll need to rebuild the boca-api image with:
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```

### Run API locally

To run API locally, you have to make sure the `mysql` is setup properly. Then use
```
yarn start:local
```
